# Balu

A self-hostable, multi-tenant todo app with first-class iOS and Android apps.
**The self-hostable todo app that feels like Things and syncs like Todoist.**

- Offline-first everywhere: every client keeps a full local replica and a durable
  command queue — no spinners, airplane mode just works.
- Natural-language quick-add in German and English ("Wäsche waschen jeden zweiten
  Dienstag #Haushalt bis Freitag"), with live token highlighting.
- Start dates and deadlines are separate things, like they should be.
- Workspaces, roles (incl. read-only viewers), invite links, task assignment,
  per-task comments.
- Notifications where self-hosters live: **ntfy, email, Telegram** — reminders,
  assignments, and comments reach you without app-store push relays.

The same data, on the phone — the mobile apps are full clients, not a web view:

or build `apps/mobile/` yourself.

## Run it

Releases are published as multi-arch images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) — no
build step, no toolchain:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/blaumedia/balu-todo:latest
```

`:latest` follows the newest release; every release also gets an immutable `:X.Y.Z`
tag — pin that one in production. Put this in a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
name: balu

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: balu
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${BALU_DB_PASSWORD:?set BALU_DB_PASSWORD in .env}
      POSTGRES_DB: balu
    volumes:
      - balu-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U balu -d balu"]
      interval: 3s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 20
    restart: unless-stopped

  app:
    image: ghcr.io/blaumedia/balu-todo:latest
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql+psycopg://balu:${BALU_DB_PASSWORD:?set BALU_DB_PASSWORD in .env}@db:5432/balu
      SECRET_KEY: ${BALU_SECRET_KEY:?set BALU_SECRET_KEY in .env}
    volumes:
      - balu-data:/data
    ports:
      - "${BALU_PORT:-8080}:8000"
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  balu-db:
  balu-data:
```

and next to it a `.env` with the two required secrets:

```sh
printf 'BALU_SECRET_KEY=%s\nBALU_DB_PASSWORD=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" "$(openssl rand -hex 16)" > .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8080, register, done. One app container + Postgres — that's the
whole deployment; the schema migrates itself on startup. Configuration via env:
`BALU_PORT`, `BALU_SECRET_KEY`, `BALU_DB_PASSWORD`, `BALU_ALLOW_REGISTRATION`,
`BALU_CORS_ORIGINS`, `BALU_MCP_ENABLED`, plus the optional notification transports - the
full list with comments is [`.env.example`](.env.example), and every one of them reaches
the container through `env_file`. Upgrading is `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

`BALU_SECRET_KEY` and `BALU_DB_PASSWORD` have **no defaults** — compose refuses to
start without them, and the server refuses to boot on a weak (<32 char) or
placeholder signing key. For a throwaway local run you can set `BALU_DEV=1` to
bypass the key check.

### Build it yourself instead

The compose file in this repo builds from source rather than pulling. Requires
Docker Compose **2.24+** (the `env_file` long syntax):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blaumedia/balu-todo && cd balu-todo
cp .env.example .env
printf 'BALU_SECRET_KEY=%s\nBALU_DB_PASSWORD=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" "$(openssl rand -hex 16)" >> .env
docker compose up --build
```

### Production notes

- Set a real `BALU_SECRET_KEY` (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) and `BALU_DB_PASSWORD`.
- CORS is same-origin by default. Only set `BALU_CORS_ORIGINS` if you serve the web
  client from a different origin than the API.
- Put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (Caddy/Traefik/nginx) in front, and set
  `BALU_ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` once **everyone who needs an account has one**.
  Read that literally: registration is the only way an account is created. A
  workspace invite adds an *existing* user to a workspace — `POST /invites/accept`
  authenticates first — so it cannot get a new person onto a closed server. To add
  someone later, flip the setting back to `true` while they sign up, then close it
  again.
- Notification transports are optional: `BALU_SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASSWORD/FROM`
  enable email, `BALU_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` enables Telegram; ntfy needs nothing.
- Back up **both** volumes: `balu-db` holds everything except attachment files,
  and `balu-data` holds those files. They are not in the database dump, so a
  database-only backup restores every task with its attachments listed and none
  of them downloadable. `BALU_MAX_ATTACHMENT_MB` (default 25) caps each upload.
- Behind a reverse proxy, set `BALU_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` to the number of proxies
  in front of Balu (usually `1`) so rate limiting keys on the real client address
  from `X-Forwarded-For`. Leave it at `0` when Balu is exposed directly —
  otherwise anyone can spoof that header and sidestep the limiter. The value is
  counted from the right, because proxies *append*, so it has to match your
  actual chain depth.
- Changing `BALU_DB_PASSWORD` after the first run does **not** re-key the database:
  Postgres only applies it when initialising an empty volume. Rotate the role
  instead — `docker compose exec db psql -U balu -d balu -c "ALTER USER balu WITH
  PASSWORD '…';"` — or start from a fresh volume.

## Claude Code (MCP)

Balu can act as a remote MCP server, so Claude Code manages your tasks directly:
"what's due this week", "file these three under Haushalt with a deadline of Friday".
It is **off by default** - turn it on per deployment:

```sh
BALU_MCP_ENABLED=true
```

Then open **Settings → Claude / MCP** in the web or mobile app and hit **Generate key**.
Nothing is minted until you ask for it; afterwards the screen shows the endpoint, the
key, and the ready-made command:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http balu https://balu.example.com/api/v1/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer balu_mcp_…"
```

The key is a bearer token with full access to that account's workspaces and it does not
expire - treat it like a password, and use **Generate a new key** in settings if it ever
leaks (every client using the old one loses access immediately). Read-only viewers stay
read-only over MCP too, and anything Claude changes syncs to web and mobile like any
other client. Tools: `list_workspaces`, `list_projects`, `list_tasks`, `get_task`,
`create_task`, `update_task`, `complete_task`, `reopen_task`, `delete_task`, `delete_project`, `add_comment`.

## Repo layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `server/` | FastAPI backend: REST auth + sync engine, serves the built web client |
| `apps/web/` | React web client (Vite + TS) |
| `apps/mobile/` | Expo/React Native app (iOS + Android) |
| `packages/` | shared TS: `@balu/domain`, `@balu/nl-parser` (de+en), `@balu/sync-client`, `@balu/api-client` |
| `docs/` | API + sync contract, screenshots |

## Development

- Backend: `cd server && make dev` (needs the test/dev Postgres: `make db`)
- Web: `pnpm install && pnpm --filter @balu/web dev` (proxies `/api` → `:8000`)
- Mobile: `pnpm --filter @balu/mobile start` — see `apps/mobile/README.md`

## Ideas

Things that might land later. No dates attached — this is a self-hosted project, and
the order will follow what people actually run into.

- **Shared-group mechanics** — fair rotation for recurring chores (round-robin /
  least-busy) and opt-in group points, for households sharing a workspace.
- **Kanban and calendar views** alongside the existing lists.
- **Grocery-mode lists** with aisle auto-grouping.
- **Capture polish** — share-sheet and intent capture on mobile, natural-language
  completion inside the date picker.

Explicit non-goals: no Gantt charts, no time tracking, no docs-and-notes platform.
Feature restraint is deliberate — capture friction is what makes a todo app stop
getting used, and every added surface is a chance to introduce some. There are also
no paid tiers to design around; self-hosted means everything is on.
